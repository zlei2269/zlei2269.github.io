<h3>Hi there, I'm Zhihao Lei &#128075;</h3>
<p align="justify">
I am a senior research fellow at the <a href="https://stat.cornell.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Department of Statistics and Data Science</a> at Cornell University. I received my BSc (Hons) with First Class Honours in Mathematics and Statistics in 2025 from the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Edinburgh</a>, United Kingdom.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Previously, I was a visiting scholar in the <a href="https://biostatistics.sph.brown.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Department of Biostatistics</a> at Brown University, where I worked with <a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/rg5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Roee Gutman</a> on Bayesian methods for causal inference and health data integration, particularly in the context of multi-treatment comparison and end-of-life healthcare analytics.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Currently, I am collaborating with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N6KebJsAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Wen Zhang</a> from Florida Atlantic University on integrating statistical learning techniques with computational genomics, focusing on transcriptome imputation and biological network modeling to uncover mechanisms underlying complex traits and psychiatric disorders.
