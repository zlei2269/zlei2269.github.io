<h3>Hi there, I'm Zhihao Lei &#128075;</h3>
<p align = "justify"> 
  I am a postdoctoral research fellow with the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Houston. I obtained my PhD in Geophysics in 2021 from <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peking University</a> (PKU), China, and BS in Geophysics in 2016 from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Class_for_the_Gifted_Young" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Special Class for the Gifted Young</a> at the <a href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Science and Technology in China</a> (USTC), China.
</p> 
<p align = "justify"> 
I am currently working with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jiajiasun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Jiajia Sun</a> and <a href="https://modal.ece.uh.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Jiefu Chen</a> on quantifying the uncertainties of geophysical inverse problems, exploring natural hydrogen resources, and investigating the formation mechanisms of oceanic plateaus using marine magnetic data.
</p>
<p align = "justify"> 
Before joining UH, I completed a two-year postdoctoral research program supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mvImZ_oAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Qinghua Huang</a> at PKU in 2023.
